# Godot 4 - Client / Server Networking Example

This repository contains simple, fully commented boilerplate networking
code for Godot 4. This networking boilerplate allows for client/server to be
ran on the same instance, allowing for easy code maintainability.

Everything required for the networking to function is within the **networking**
directory.
